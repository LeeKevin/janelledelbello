This project "**D2L Essentials**" was my first foray into basic e-learning authoring using Adobe Captivate. I made this 
module with the intent of sharing it remotely with Sessional Instructors who teach at the University of Calgary. 
[D2L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D2L) support is often the top priority for Sessional Instructors when they contact 
me. As a result, this was a perfect topic to address with an e-learning module. 

There are three parts:
1. [Create a Grade Category](/extra/d2l-essentials/create-grade-category)
2. [Create a Grade Item](/extra/d2l-essentials/create-grade-item)
3. [Complete the Grades Setup Wizard](/extra/d2l-essentials/grades-setup-wizard)

Draft 1.0 was too lengthy, linear and a bit boring so I went back to the drawing board to create 2.0. For the final 
product seen here, I divided the original step-by-step how-to into three separate projects, removed non-essential 
instructions and beefed up my slides. I also opted to make the Grade Item and Grade Category projects into interactive learning modules and saved the straight oral instructions for the Grades Setup Wizard project.

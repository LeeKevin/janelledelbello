This project was my first foray into basic e-learning authoring using Adobe Captivate. I made this module with the intent of sharing it remotely with Sessional Instructors who teach at the University of Calgary. [D2L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D2L) support is often the top priority of Sessional Instructors when they contact me so this felt like the perfect topic to address with my e-learning module. 

Draft 1.0 was too lengthy, linear and a bit boring so I went back to the drawing board to create 2.0. For the final product, I divided the original step-by-step how-to into three separate projects, removed non-essential instructions and beefed up my slides. I also opted to make the Grade Item and Grade Category projects into interactive learning modules and saved the straight oral instructions for the Grades Setup Wizard project.

This is the second project I created in Adobe Captivate. I’ve been listening to Radio Lingua’s [Coffee Break French](<http://www.coffeebreakfrench.com/>) lately and was feeling inspired by their approach to language learning so I figured I’d try my hand at a simple French e-learning module. My main goal for this project was to include elements of gamification. I wanted learners to be able to select the order in which they engaged with the challenges as well as to earn badges as they correctly completed questions. I spent quite a bit of time trying to configure the slides to suit my project goals without knowing much about how interactions work in Captivate. For my next project I plan research the features and limitations of these interactions before trying to bring gamified elements to life.[Give it a try <i>si vous voulez<i>](/extra/le-cafe-francais)!

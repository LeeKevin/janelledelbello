I created this e-learning module based on cognitivist principles (specifically Gagn√©'s Nine Events of Instruction) for my ITEC 800 course. I designed this module within the larger framework of a flipped classroom approach to teaching the principles of good design. The goal of this module is to review the course content for learners prior to their completion of a culminating design assignment.

#### Hi! I'm Janelle Delbello

> Teacher turned instructional designer & technical writer

I believe in making learning exciting, accessible and effective for diverse audiences. My educational experience
 has taken me across the world--Iâ€™ve taught K-12 students from Alberta, Canada to South Korea! No matter where I go, 
 I carry with me a sense of adaptability, innovation, and creativity to build learning solutions.
 
At the present, I'm working in post-secondary education with a new-found passion for adult learning.

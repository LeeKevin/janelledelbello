#### Hi! I'm Janelle Delbello

> Teacher turned instructional designer & technical writer

I believe in making learning exciting, accessible and effective for diverse audiences. My educational experience
 has taken me across the world--I’ve taught K-12 students from Alberta, Canada to South Korea! No matter where I go, 
 I carry with me a sense of adaptability, innovation, and creativity to build learning solutions.
 
 I graduated with a Master of Arts in Education: Instructional Technologies at San Francisco State University.
 
I’m currently working as an instructional designer at [Intuitive](https://www.intuitive.com/).
